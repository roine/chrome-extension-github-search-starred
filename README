## Presentation

**GitHub starred search** is a tiny chrome extension used to search my GitHub starred repositories. For now it's not flexible at all and will only search in my account the informations. However if you're comfortable with JavaScript simply edit [script.js](https://github.com/roine/chrome-extension-github-search-starred/blob/master/script.js) with your username

## How to Use

- Clone it
- Add it to Chrome
- Type ghs in the omnibox, press <kbd>tab</kbd> and start to search the repository you want
